# Get Started

ZeroMQ (also spelled ØMQ, 0MQ or ZMQ) is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library, aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications. It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a ZeroMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker.

ZeroMQ supports common messaging patterns (pub/sub, request/reply, client/server and others) over a variety of transports (TCP, in-process, inter-process, multicast and more), making inter-process messaging as simple as inter-thread messaging. This keeps your code clear, modular and extremely easy to scale.

ZeroMQ is developed by a large community of contributors. There are third-party bindings for many popular programming languages and native ports for C# and Java.

## The Guide

[The guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all) explains how to use ØMQ, covers basic, intermediate and advanced use with 60+ diagrams and 750 examples in 28 languages.
